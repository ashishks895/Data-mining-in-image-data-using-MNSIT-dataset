Designing neural network on MNIST handwritten digits images to identify their correct label


<h2>Data Science Problem:</h2>
This data science problem I am designing neural net on MNIST handwritten digits images to identify their correct label i.e number in image. 
Here we can use the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification. It also includes how to save the model and later load it to make predictions on new data.


**Dataset required in this case study:** 
* MNIST dataset
* You can directly load the dataset from keras using: `from keras.datasets import mnist`
* You may need install tensorflow and keras first: https://keras.io/ 


**We used three deep learning models as follows:**
1) Baseline Model with Multi-Layer Perceptrons
2) Simple Convolutional Neural Network
3) Larger Convolutional Neural Network

**For making prediction:**
Atlast for making predictions for new image we used a sample image as provided in the repo, kindly save that image in the same folder. Also we made prediction on the Larger CNN model since it was giving outstanding accuracy.
